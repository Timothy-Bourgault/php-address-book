# _Address Book_

#### _An app for storing a user's contacts, Friday, September 9th, 2016_

#### By _**Timothy Alan Bourgault**_

## Description

_A basic prototype for an address book application that allows users to enter contact information into a form and submit that contact information to be saved.  The purpose of this app is to help users organize their contacts so they can lead happier lives.  Once the user has entered the name, phone number, and address of a contact, they can press the submit button under the form to be directed to a page telling them that their contact has been saved to their address book.  On that page, their is another button which when the user clicks it will return the user to the original page, only now the contact information that they entered is displayed below the Contacts: field.  Once there have been contacts added to the Address Book, the user is then given the option to delete all the contacts by pressing the Clear All Contacts button at the bottom of the page.  Once they have cleared their contacts the user is directed to yet another page which tells them they have cleared their address book, and also gives them the option to create a new address book.  If the user decides to click the link to create a new address book, they are redirected back to the original page that no longer has any stored contacts and can then begin a new address book by adding a new contact in the form.  This address book app is simple, yet efficient._
